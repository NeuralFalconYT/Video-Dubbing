The transcription with speaker diarization in this project is adapted from [whisper-diarization-advanced](https://github.com/rafaelgalle/whisper-diarization-advanced) by **[@rafaelgalle](https://github.com/rafaelgalle)**.
This forms the foundation for extracting speaker-labeled transcripts used in the video dubbing pipeline.

### whisper-diarization-advanced:
The transcription with speaker diarization in this project is adapted from [whisper-diarization-advanced](https://github.com/rafaelgalle/whisper-diarization-advanced) by **[@rafaelgalle](https://github.com/rafaelgalle)**.
This forms the foundation for extracting speaker-labeled transcripts used in the video dubbing pipeline.

### Chatterbox:
This project uses the **Chatterbox** text-to-speech and voice cloning system, developed by [Resemble AI](https://github.com/resemble-ai).  

Original repository: [https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox)

We integrate Chatterbox's multilingual TTS and voice cloning capabilities in this video dubbing project.  
All credit for the TTS model architecture, voice cloning algorithms, and base implementation goes to the Chatterbox team.
